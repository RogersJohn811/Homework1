# Homework1

This is my README file that goes over the steps I took to clean up the code.

# HTML CHANGES

1. On line 7, I changed the title to the company name
2. On Line 12, I got rid of the H1 header .seo
3. Through lines 30-65 & 67-101, I made it so all three id's were put under the same class so that the css could be condensed.
4. On line 32, I adjusted the SEO link address so it would work properly

# CSS CHANGES
